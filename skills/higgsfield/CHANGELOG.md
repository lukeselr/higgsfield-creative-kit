# Changelog

## v3.7.0 — 2026-05-04

### Changed

- **`generate_user_guide.py` Path B refactor (Option D scope)** — version metadata + sub-skill list parameterization. Eliminates the manual sync burden that left the PDF six releases stale by v3.6.1. Specifically:
  - Sub-bullet: New `read_root_metadata()` helper parses root `SKILL.md` frontmatter for `version`, `updated`, `author`. Custom 30-line stdlib-only parser; no new dependencies (script remains `fpdf`-only on the third-party side).
  - Sub-bullet: New `discover_sub_skills()` helper walks `skills/*/` for SKILL.md presence; excludes `shared/` utility directory.
  - Sub-bullet: New `SUB_SKILL_DESCRIPTIONS` dict at top of script holds the editorial summaries for the Section 22 sub-skill table — preserves v3.6.5 byte-for-byte equivalence (frontmatter `description:` fields are routing-trigger language, not editorial summaries; using them would be a content regression).
  - Sub-bullet: Build-time invariant check: filesystem-discovered sub-skill set must equal `SUB_SKILL_DESCRIPTIONS.keys()`; mismatch raises with a clear "update the dict" error message. **Catches the staleness scenario** (a new sub-skill was added without updating the PDF) at build time instead of letting the PDF silently drift.
  - Sub-bullet: 5 hardcoded version strings replaced with `META['version']` references (line 16 header, line 139 cover, line 743 FAQ Q5, line 763 footer; module docstring rewritten without inline version).
  - Sub-bullet: Hardcoded date strings (line 139 cover, line 763 footer) replaced with `META['updated']`.
  - Sub-bullet: Hardcoded author string ("O-Side Media", lines 139 + 763) replaced with `META['author']`.
  - Sub-bullet: PDF creation date pinned via `pdf.set_creation_date(datetime.fromisoformat(META['updated']))` for reproducible binary builds (FPDF2's default embeds wall-clock time in `/CreationDate`, breaking binary diff).
  - Sub-bullet: Section 22 "Sub-Skills (20 total)" count is now `f"Sub-Skills ({len(SUB_SKILL_DESCRIPTIONS)} total)"` — auto-updates when a new sub-skill is added.
  - Sub-bullet: **Root-files table at Section 22 kept hardcoded.** Set is small, stable, descriptions are editorial; dynamic walk would either break byte-for-byte (by including all root .md/.py/.pdf files) or require an allowlist (defeating the purpose). Cost-of-hardcoded ≈ zero, value-of-dynamic ≈ near-zero for this case.
- **FAQ Q5 staleness bug fix** — line 743 said "currently v3.0.0" since pre-v3.6.2 (wrong even within the v3.6.2 build). Now parameterized via `META['version']`, reads "currently v3.7.0" in this build and tracks every future release.
- **New repo file: `validate_user_guide.py`** — lightweight (~190 lines including methodology docstring) validation script. Three-layer validation: build-time invariants (in-script raises), text-extract diff (`pdftotext -layout` or `pdfplumber` fallback) against a frozen baseline PDF with version/date/count patterns normalized away, and binary diff (post-timestamp-pinning, informational). Run before any future PDF regeneration to catch unintended drift. Opens with a methodology docstring documenting what counts as an allowed change vs a regression so future maintainers can read the script's purpose without reverse-engineering the regex patterns.
- **`USER-GUIDE.pdf` regenerated** by the refactored script. Layer 1 text-extract diff against frozen v3.6.5 baseline: PASS (zero substantive content regressions after normalizing version/date/count patterns). Layer 2 binary diff: bytes differ throughout the PDF's compressed object streams — expected behavior, since small text changes (v3.6.5 → v3.7.0, 2026-04-25 → 2026-05-04) cascade through deflate-compressed streams shifting many byte positions. Page count unchanged at 19 pages.
- **Backlog cleanup in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md`** — section header re-labeled "v3.6.5+ planning" → "v3.7.0+ planning". Path B refactor row struck with closure annotation. USER-GUIDE comprehensive expansion row stays open with a v3.7.1+ note that explicitly enumerates the drift catalog (D3-D8) as the v3.7.1+ content scope. AI director toggle row remains open (BLOCKED — function unverified).
- **Frontmatter version bump** — root `SKILL.md` 3.6.5 → 3.7.0. `updated` field unchanged at 2026-05-04 (same-day release). No sub-skill frontmatter bumps — refactor is build-tooling only, no sub-skill content changed.

### Sourcing

- Path B refactor — sourced from the original 2026-04-25 v3.6.0 audit observation that the PDF was 6 releases stale; tracked as MEDIUM-priority backlog row across v3.6.x. Scope locked to Option D after structural read of the existing 770-line generator surfaced architectural cost asymmetries between options.

### Notes

- **Option D scope rationale (why not Option B).** The structural read of `generate_user_guide.py` recalibrated the audit's "~3-4 hours" estimate against four viable refactor shapes: Option A (metadata-only, ~2h), Option D (Option A + sub-skill enumeration, ~1.5-2h), Option C (hybrid with content-in-YAML, ~3-4h), and Option B (full SKILL.md parsing with custom markdown→FPDF renderer, ~10-15h). The audit's estimate was calibrated for Option C scope but described Option B language. Option B's true cost (markdown parser + table-width pinning + 5 synthesized sections without SKILL.md homes + heading-anchor stability + ongoing maintenance burden) significantly exceeds the value delivered by Option D for the *concrete* staleness problem (version metadata + sub-skill count). Option D ships the cheapest refactor that solves the staleness pain that motivated the row.
- **What's deferred to v3.7.1+ (drift catalog).** v3.7.0 ships v3.6.5-equivalent PDF content (byte-for-byte except metadata bytes after pattern normalization). Content drift between the PDF and current SKILL.md content remains, catalogued during scoping as items D3 through D8: Cinema Studio 3.5 selection guide unreflected; the 5 Seedance prompt modes (incl. v3.6.4 Transformation prompt mode) unreflected in Section 10; v3.6.3 Soul Cinema and v3.6.4 Studio Look re-pass unreflected in Section 11; v3.6.4 Iteration Rule + 6-Pass Diagnostic Sequence unreflected in Section 18; v3.6.0 Reference Sheet Types and v3.6.4 piano test / Action Design / Morph-Cut breathing room unreflected in Section 21; sub-skill row descriptions unreflected for v3.6.4 additions in Section 22. **All deferred to v3.7.1+** as content-expansion work, not refactor scope.
- **`refactor:` introduced as fourth Conventional Commits prefix** in repo history. Prior prefixes: `feat:` (v3.4.0–v3.6.0, v3.6.3, v3.6.4 — new content arcs), `chore:` (v3.6.1 — config), `docs:` (v3.6.2, v3.6.5 — content polish). `refactor:` semantics: code reorganization that does not change observable behavior or content. v3.7.0 fits — the generated PDF's content is byte-equivalent to v3.6.5 (per Layer 1 text-extract diff after pattern normalization) except for metadata bytes (which the refactor itself fixes as a deliberate change, not a regression).
- **Validation results.** Layer 1 text-extract diff against frozen v3.6.5 baseline: PASS — zero substantive differences flagged after normalizing version/date/count patterns. Layer 2 binary diff: 28247 byte positions differ in a 33648-byte file — expected behavior because PDF deflate-compressed object streams cascade-shift on small text changes; Layer 1 is the authoritative content check. No content regressions. No layout shifts (page count unchanged at 19).
- **Build-time staleness protection.** Future releases that add a new sub-skill will trigger the filesystem-vs-`SUB_SKILL_DESCRIPTIONS` invariant check at build time, raising with a clear error message. The PDF cannot silently drift on the sub-skill list anymore.
- **No sub-skill content changed. No new sub-skills, no routing changes, no SKILL.md edits beyond the root frontmatter version bump.**

Commit prefix: `refactor: v3.7.0 — generate_user_guide.py Path B refactor (Option D — metadata + sub-skill list parameterization)`

## v3.6.5 — 2026-05-04

### Changed

- **Marketing-copy strip on `skills/higgsfield-models/MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md`** — file-wide style normalization removing product-marketing language while preserving all capability and routing information. Nine surgical edits:
  - Sub-bullet: `### Kling 3.0 ⭐ EXCLUSIVE — Current Top Model` → `### Kling 3.0` (plan-availability badge + promotional positioning stripped; `Best for:` and `Strengths:` lines below carry the routing info)
  - Sub-bullet: `### Kling 3.0 Omni ⭐ EXCLUSIVE` → `### Kling 3.0 Omni`
  - Sub-bullet: `### Kling 3.0 Omni Edit ⭐ EXCLUSIVE` → `### Kling 3.0 Omni Edit`
  - Sub-bullet: `### Kling 3.0 Motion Control ⭐ NEW (March 25, 2026)` → `### Kling 3.0 Motion Control (added March 25, 2026)` (`⭐ NEW` temporal marketing stripped; date reframed as factual provenance)
  - Sub-bullet: Sora 2 Strengths line — `Best-in-class for large-scale events` → `Strongest at large-scale events` (canonical kept-form per the strip rule: "Strongest at X" preserves capability claim without superlative positioning)
  - Sub-bullet: Kling 2.6 audio capabilities header — `**Audio capabilities (class-leading at this tier):**` → `**Audio capabilities:**` (parenthetical superlative stripped; bulleted capability list below carries the routing info)
  - Sub-bullet: Aurora text/logos strength row — `One of Aurora's top differentiators — most models fail here` → `Where Aurora outperforms most models — most models fail here` (positioning language stripped; capability claim preserved verbatim)
  - Sub-bullet: Video Imagine 1.0 — vendor-quoted `"best-in-class instruction following for video generation"` bullet removed entirely (quoted vendor marketing carries no routing info; adjacent bullets carry capability content)
  - Sub-bullet: Nano Banana Pro Strengths line — `Best image quality on the platform` → `Strongest image quality on the platform`
- **Cross-file marketing-copy strip in `skills/higgsfield-apps/SKILL.md`** — line 117 `Cinema Studio is Higgsfield's premium filmmaking environment` → `Cinema Studio is Higgsfield's professional filmmaking environment`. Matches the precedent in `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` (which already uses "professional filmmaking environment" in the equivalent slot).
- **Audio-block diversity pass on the five Seedance 2.0 worked examples in `prompt-examples.md`** — v3.6.4 shipped all five examples with the same audio-block compositional shape (primary action + environmental texture + distant element + low/no music indicator). v3.6.5 varies the shapes one-to-one across the five examples:
  - Sub-bullet: Underground Parking Pursuit (Action) — **foreground-heavy** shape (close-mic'd breath and stride detail leading; environmental sound demoted with attenuation cues)
  - Sub-bullet: Hospital Vigil II (Drama) — **music-foregrounded** shape (single sustained low cello note as structural element, swelling through the emotional break; diegetic sound recedes beneath it; no spoken dialog added)
  - Sub-bullet: Derelict Station Approach (Sci-Fi) — **sound-design-anchored** shape (audio framed as designed/constructed/treated rather than captured; SFX-design vocabulary throughout: treated drone, constructed hull groans, EQ'd helmet breath)
  - Sub-bullet: Coffee Beans — Label Iteration (Product) — **ambient-heavy** shape ("same as source" Edit Shot framing preserved; kitchen ambience layered as primary content with refrigerator hum, traffic, air; foreground sounds placed *inside* the ambience)
  - Sub-bullet: Awakening II (Transformation) — **dialog-anchored as wordless vocal performance** shape (her hum anchors the scene with timbre/dynamic/transformation-arc detail; surrounding sound recedes; no spoken-word content — the vocal performance is wordless throughout)
- **Backlog cleanup in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md`** — section header re-labeled "v3.6.4+ planning" → "v3.6.5+ planning"; two rows struck with closure annotations (marketing-copy strip closed by Item A above; audio-block diversity closed by Item B above). Three rows remain open: AI director toggle behavioral documentation (BLOCKED — function unverified), Path B generator refactor (v3.7.x+), USER-GUIDE comprehensive expansion (v3.7.x+).
- **Frontmatter version bumps** — root `SKILL.md` 3.6.4 → 3.6.5; `skills/higgsfield-models/SKILL.md` 3.0.0 → 3.0.1; `skills/higgsfield-apps/SKILL.md` 3.0.0 → 3.0.1. All `updated` fields set to 2026-05-04. Patch-level bumps on the two sub-skills because the changes are content-polish style normalization, not feature additions.

### Sourcing

- Marketing-copy strip — sourced from the original 2026-04-25 v3.6.0 review observation, tracked as a backlog row (LOW priority) since v3.6.0. Strip rule applied per Peter's clarification: strip product-marketing modifiers (plan-availability badges like ⭐ EXCLUSIVE, promotional positioning like Current Top Model, superlative claims like best-in-class / class-leading / top differentiators); keep capability and routing language ("Strongest at X" claims, technical specs, concrete capability descriptors).
- Audio-block diversity pass — sourced from the 2026-05-03 v3.6.4 release review note, tracked as a v3.6.5+ backlog row added during v3.6.4 cleanup. Five-shape taxonomy applied: foreground-heavy / music-foregrounded / sound-design-anchored / ambient-heavy / dialog-anchored.

### Notes

- **Close-out cleanup release.** v3.6.5 closes the two remaining LOW-priority backlog rows from the v3.6.0 audit + v3.6.4 cleanup. After this release, the only open items in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md` are the BLOCKED AI director toggle row and two v3.7.x+ planned items (Path B refactor + USER-GUIDE expansion). The v3.6.x cycle is content-complete.
- **Strip rule sharpened during scoping** — "premium" stripped when it's a plan-tier marketing modifier on the platform itself (one cross-file hit in `higgsfield-apps/SKILL.md`); kept when it's workflow vocabulary describing model cost tiers within a routing pipeline (e.g., `higgsfield-pipeline/SKILL.md` Stage 8 routing pseudocode, `higgsfield-assist/SKILL.md` cost-tier guidance). Both retained-context hits preserved verbatim.
- **No cross-file false positives.** Wider repo scan surfaced one anti-pattern *example* in `templates/02-product-ugc-showcase.md` (`"Measurable lighting — not 'looks premium'"`) and one anti-slop vocabulary list in `docs/Seedance 2 Skill.md` — both are documentation *against* marketing language and were preserved.
- **Audio-block stylistic discipline.** Each new audio block demonstrates its named shape through composition rather than enumeration — a reader can read the shape off the prose without needing the label. Foreground/background mix structure made explicit via attenuation cues; designed audio flagged with SFX-design vocabulary; musical structure tied to scene emotional read.
- **B2 wordless preserved.** Hospital Vigil II remains wordless after the diversity pass — the v3.6.4 example's narrative content (a wordless emotional beat between husband and unconscious wife) is preserved; the diversification works at the audio-mix level only, with a sustained cello carrying what dialog would otherwise carry.
- **No new sub-skills, no new content arcs, no routing changes.** Surgical content polish only.

Commit prefix: `docs: v3.6.5 — marketing-copy strip on MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md + audio-block diversity pass on Seedance worked examples`

## v3.6.4 — 2026-05-03

### Added

- **6-Pass Diagnostic Sequence subsection** in `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` — new `### When You Don't Know What's Wrong Yet — the 6-Pass Diagnostic Sequence` h3 inserted into the existing Iteration Rule section. Six-variable diagnostic sequence (subject → action → camera → style → audio → output) for finding which variable to change when the Iteration Rule's "pick the one that's wrong" can't be answered yet. Frames the 6-Pass as a finder, not a refinement loop — once the variable is identified, the Iteration Rule takes over.
  - Sub-bullet: PDF order preserved verbatim (subject / action / camera / style / audio / output).
  - Sub-bullet: cross-link added in `skills/higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` Related Skills section pointing back at the new subsection.
- **Transformation prompt mode** added to `skills/higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` — fifth mode in the Seedance 2.0 Prompt Modes catalog, alongside Reference-Based, Continuation, Expand Shot, and Edit Shot. Describes a state change inside a single clip (distinct from Continuation, which extends time across two clips, and Edit Shot, which patches a generated clip after the fact).
  - Sub-bullet: section opener at L80 updated from "four generation modes" → "five generation modes".
  - Sub-bullet: Mode Selection Rule paragraph extended with Transformation routing logic.
  - Sub-bullet: full prose phrase "Transformation prompt mode" used wherever ambiguity with the existing Transformation genre in `prompt-examples.md` is possible. One-line disambiguation gloss added to the top of the `prompt-examples.md` Transformation genre section.
- **Action Design Rules subsection** in `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` — new `### Action Design Around AI Strengths` h3 appended to the (renamed) Fight Scene & Action Design Rules section. Adapted from the Mr. Core methodology — covers location selection (forgiving vs. punishing spaces), choreography around model strengths, the one-transformation-per-shot rule, and single-generation strategy.
- **Morph-Cut breathing room** in `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` Multi-Shot Manual subsection — explicit 2-second still-or-near-still moments at the start and end of every shot to give editors morph-cut and smooth-cut landing points. Adapted from the Mr. Core methodology.
- **The piano test** in `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` Outfit/Material Sheet subsection — wardrobe complexity has a generation cost; if a wardrobe element is as visually demanding as a piano in the frame, the model spends its budget rendering it instead of the action. Strip wardrobe to the simplest silhouette that reads as the character. Adapted from the Mr. Core methodology.
- **Studio Look vs. Cinematic Look — Soul Cinema as the Re-Pass** subsection in `skills/higgsfield-soul/SKILL.md` — new h3 inside the existing Soul Cinema as the CS 3.0/3.5 Default Image Model section. Diagnoses the studio look (clean / evenly lit / glossy / plastic-feeling), prescribes the re-pass workflow through Soul Cinema with explicit grade / lighting / lens / palette direction. Adapted from the Mr. Core methodology. Includes explicit gloss disambiguating "studio look" (visual quality of output) from "Cinema Studio" (the product).
- **Five Seedance 2.0 worked examples** added to `prompt-examples.md` — one per chosen genre, each with full audio block as a first-class element:
  - Sub-bullet: Action → Underground Parking Pursuit (Reference-Based mode)
  - Sub-bullet: Drama → Hospital Vigil II (Continuation mode)
  - Sub-bullet: Sci-Fi → Derelict Station Approach (Reference-Based mode)
  - Sub-bullet: Product/Commercial → Coffee Beans — Label Iteration (Edit Shot mode)
  - Sub-bullet: Transformation → Awakening II (Transformation prompt mode)
- **Three template cross-links** in `templates/01-cinematic-action-chase.md`, `templates/02-product-ugc-showcase.md`, `templates/05-sci-fi-vfx.md` pointing at the new Seedance worked examples in `prompt-examples.md`.

### Changed

- **Section rename in `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md`** — "Fight Scene Rules (Tested)" → "Fight Scene & Action Design Rules (Tested)" to accommodate the new Action Design subsection.
- **One-line cross-link in `skills/higgsfield-pipeline/SKILL.md` Stage 8 — Assembly** pointing at the Morph-Cut breathing room rule for cut-friendly source-material generation.
- **Backlog cleanup in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md`** — section header re-labeled "v3.6.3+ planning" → "v3.6.4+ planning"; eight rows struck (the four Mr. Core sub-concepts shipped here, the 6-Pass Testing Protocol gap-check, the Transformation prompt mode, the Seedance worked-example library, and the stale Per-Cinematic-model deep workflow guidance row that v3.6.3 already closed). Three rows remain open (AI director toggle BLOCKED, product-marketing language strip LOW, Path B refactor + USER-GUIDE expansion v3.7.x+); one new row added (audio-block diversity pass — see Notes).
- **Frontmatter version bumps** — root `SKILL.md` 3.6.3 → 3.6.4; `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` 3.1.0 → 3.2.0; `skills/higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0; `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` 3.1.0 → 3.2.0; `skills/higgsfield-soul/SKILL.md` 3.1.0 → 3.2.0. `skills/higgsfield-pipeline/SKILL.md` updated-date refreshed only (single one-line cross-link, no version bump). All `updated` fields set to 2026-05-03.

### Sourcing

All four content arcs are sourced from `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md` — the GAP candidates flagged for v3.6.1+ deferral during the v3.6.0 audit. No new external source material this release; this is the deferred-backlog payoff release.

- 6-Pass Diagnostic Sequence — Seedance 2.0 Prompt Modes slide deck item 8 + Seedance Promt modes prose handbook (sibling pair, GAP/PENDING-CHECK in v3.6.0 audit).
- Transformation prompt mode — Seedance 2 Serious Examples Supplement item 9 (GAP/deferred in v3.6.0 audit).
- Seedance 2.0 worked-example library — Seedance 2 Serious Examples Supplement (REINFORCE-only in v3.6.0 audit, integrated as worked illustrations of existing patterns).
- Mr. Core methodology (4 sub-concepts) — Building a Cinematic Universe Mr. Core long-form items 3, 4–6 (collapsed to "Action choreography"), 7, 8 (GAPs in v3.6.0 audit).

The v3.6.0 audit flagged the 6-Pass as PENDING-CHECK — the gap-check verdict is recorded above as PARTIAL GAP: the Iteration Rule covers the single-variable principle; the 6-Pass adds a prescribed diagnostic order and includes audio + output axes the Iteration Rule does not name. The 6-Pass therefore ships as a subordinate diagnostic tool inside the Iteration Rule section, not as a competing rule.

### Notes

- **Largest release in repo history.** Bundles four unrelated arcs into one merge — a 6-pass diagnostic, a fifth Seedance prompt mode, a Mr. Core methodology pass distributed across cinema and soul, and a Seedance worked-example library expansion. Total ~5–6 hours of content work; release process overhead handled separately.
- **Distributed Mr. Core placement.** Methodology integrated where each piece lands most naturally — Action Design + Morph-Cut breathing room + piano test in `higgsfield-cinema`, Studio→Cinematic re-pass in `higgsfield-soul`, lightweight cross-link from `higgsfield-pipeline` Stage 8. No "Mr. Core" in any section header; attribution lives in body text only ("adapted from the Mr. Core methodology").
- **"Studio look" disambiguation.** First appearance of the term in `higgsfield-soul` includes an explicit gloss distinguishing the visual-quality sense ("studio-feeling output") from the Cinema Studio product. Full phrasing — "studio look," "studio-feeling" — used throughout the new content; bare "studio" avoided where it could be confused.
- **Templates cross-link gap.** Only 3 of the 5 chosen Item 3 genres (Action, Product/Commercial, Sci-Fi) have corresponding files in `templates/`. Drama and Transformation templates do not exist; Item 3 cross-links those two genres only inside `prompt-examples.md`, not in `templates/`. New Drama / Transformation templates deferred — earn their own future release if the gap stays felt.
- **No v3.6.0 Cinema Studio framing changes.** Studio-look disambiguation lives entirely in new content; no concurrent edits to existing Cinema Studio 3.5 sections.
- **No new sub-skills, no routing changes, no Featured-models documentation drift.**
- **Audio-block diversity pass deferred** — all five Seedance worked examples use the same compositional shape (primary action + environmental texture + distant element + low/no music indicator). A future release could vary this with foreground-heavy, ambient-heavy, music-foregrounded, dialog-anchored, or sound-design-anchored audio shapes. Tracked as v3.6.5+ backlog.

Commit prefix: `feat: v3.6.4 — Mr. Core methodology + Seedance 5th prompt mode + 6-Pass + Seedance worked examples`

## v3.6.3 — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Per-Cinematic-model selection guide subsection** in `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` — new `#### Per-Cinematic-model selection guide` h4 inserted between the resolution table and the existing Cinematic Cameras h4. Covers Soul Cinema (the default), Cinematic Characters (expressive faces and styling), and Cinematic Locations (environments and atmosphere) with 1–2 paragraphs each on when to pick the model, what intent it serves, and what to use it for vs avoid. The existing Cinematic Cameras h4 remains in place as the fourth per-model dive.
- **Soul Cinema subsection in `higgsfield-soul/SKILL.md`** — new `## Soul Cinema as the CS 3.0/3.5 Default Image Model` subsection with Soul ID identity-anchor prompting pattern adapted for image mode (Identity Block + Scene/Style Block, since image generation has no temporal axis). Closes the v3.6.2 USER-GUIDE row description promise that previously cross-referenced Soul Cinema content the sub-skill did not have, and pays off the existing route-out from `higgsfield-cinema` line 1589.

### Changed

- **Cleanup of "deferred to a future release" hooks in `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md`** — picker-table h4 hook and Cinematic Cameras h4 blockquote updated to reflect that selection guidance now ships in this release. Sample prompts, Featured-models-in-image-mode framing, the Save Setup workflow, and video-mode's parallel Cinematic/Featured picker remain explicitly deferred.
- **Frontmatter version bumps** — root `SKILL.md` 3.6.2 → 3.6.3; `skills/higgsfield-soul/SKILL.md` 3.0.0 → 3.1.0 with `updated` field set to 2026-04-25; `skills/higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` `updated` field unchanged at 2026-04-25.

### Sourcing

No new UI verification this release. Per-Cinematic-model selection-guide content is derived from the v3.6.0 UI-verification pass (2026-04-25) that produced the original four-row picker table, plus the v3.6.2 USER-GUIDE refresh contract that promised Soul Cinema coverage in `higgsfield-soul`. The `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md` gap analysis remains the source of record for the picker structure. Pipeline E references to "Soul Cinema" in `higgsfield-pipeline/SKILL.md` were verified as picker-context (post-v3.6.0 default Cinematic model), not Preview-context — the Part 1 cross-link from the Soul Cinema selection-guide entry into Pipeline E is correct.

### Notes

Selection-guide-only depth: each model gets 1–2 paragraphs covering pick / intent / use / avoid. Sample prompts specific to each Cinematic model are deferred to v3.6.4+ if the gap stays felt — `templates/` and `prompt-examples.md` already cover prompting at the genre level, and per-Cinematic-model sample prompts would partially overlap with both. Closes the v3.6.2 USER-GUIDE row description promise. Vocabulary discipline preserved: Soul Cinema / Cinematic Characters / Cinematic Locations are described without 2.5 optical vocabulary; only Cinematic Cameras inherits 2.5's Camera Body / Lens / Focal Length / Aperture stack. `model-guide.md`, `image-models.md`, `vocab.md`, and `higgsfield-pipeline/SKILL.md` left untouched — their "Soul Cinema Preview" mentions refer to the older standalone model, not the picker-context Soul Cinema. `MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md` verified as exclusively Featured-model documentation in its Image Models section (Soul 2.0, Nano Banana Pro, Seedream 4.5, Flux Kontext) — left untouched.

Two LIMITED MODIFICATIONs to pre-existing skill content:

1. The deferred-hook in the picker-table h4 of `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` (previously: "Per-model deep workflow guidance ... is deferred to a future release") updated to point at the new `§ Per-Cinematic-model selection guide`, with the deferral language narrowed to "sample prompts specific to each Cinematic model."
2. The deferred-hook blockquote in the Cinematic Cameras h4 of `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` (previously: "Per-Cinematic-model deep workflow guidance is deferred to a future release") updated to reflect that selection guidance now ships, with the still-deferred items explicitly enumerated (sample prompts, Featured-models-in-image-mode framing, Save Setup workflow, video-mode picker coverage).

Commit prefix: `feat: v3.6.3 — per-Cinematic-model selection guide + Soul Cinema in higgsfield-soul`

  - Section 22 sub-skill table corrected from 18 → 20 (added `higgsfield-seedance` from v3.2.0 + `higgsfield-workspaces` from v3.4.0; refreshed `higgsfield-soul` and `higgsfield-cinema` row descriptions)
  - FAQ "what changed?" answer updated to summarize v3.3.0 → v3.6.2 themes and delegate full detail to CHANGELOG
- **`docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md`** backlog table re-labeled and re-prioritized: section header now reads v3.6.3+; "Per-Cinematic-model deep workflow guidance" priority bumped MEDIUM → HIGH (natural follow-on to v3.6.0 Image Mode subsection); two new entries added for v3.7.x+ planning (Path B generator refactor; comprehensive USER-GUIDE expansion bundled with that refactor).
- **Root `SKILL.md`** frontmatter version bumped 3.6.1 → 3.6.2 / 2026-04-25.

### Notes
- **Light refresh, not full refresh.** Deep feature documentation lives in `SKILL.md` files; the USER-GUIDE PDF is an overview artifact. Comprehensive new PDF sections for Cinema Studio 3.5 / Image Mode / Elements / Physics Matrix / Motion Control / workspace-first / Reference Sheet Types are deferred to v3.7.x+ as part of the Path B generator refactor.
- **Path B generator refactor deferred to v3.7.x+** — `generate_user_guide.py` currently hardcodes all content as Python string literals (no `SKILL.md` parsing). By v3.6.1 the PDF was 6 releases stale precisely because every release requires manual script edits. Refactoring the generator to parse `SKILL.md` files dynamically would eliminate the manual sync burden but is a substantial standalone release (~3–4 hours of refactor + validation) and should not mix with content writing.
- Pure documentation refresh. No skill content changes. No new sub-skills. No routing changes. No LIMITED MODIFICATIONs.
- Third Conventional Commits prefix in repo history (`docs:`) following `feat:` (v3.4.0–v3.6.0) and `chore:` (v3.6.1).

## v3.6.1 — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `.markdownlint.json` at repo root — config to silence intentional CHANGELOG conventions. MD022 (blanks around headings) and MD032 (blanks around lists) disabled file-wide. MD024 (no duplicate headings) refined to `siblings_only`, which allows repeated `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Sourcing` / `### Notes` subheadings under different `## vX.Y.Z` parents — the Keep-A-Changelog pattern. MD013 (line length) also disabled for long-form bullets.

### Changed
- Root `SKILL.md` frontmatter version bumped to 3.6.1 / 2026-04-25.

### Notes
- Pure infrastructure change — no skill content, no model documentation, no behavioral change to any sub-skill. Resolves 241 pre-existing markdownlint warnings on `CHANGELOG.md` that flagged intentional repo conventions across v3.2.0 through v3.6.0.
- No new sub-skills, no routing changes, no LIMITED MODIFICATIONs.

## v3.6.0 — 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Cinema Studio 3.5 section** in `higgsfield-cinema` — three-pill main UI surface (Genre / Style / Camera), Style Settings panel three-axis preset stacking (8 Color Palette / 6 Lighting / 9 Camera Moveset Style), Manual Style free-form mode, Camera Settings four-axis panel (3 Camera Body / 5 Lens / 5 Focal Length including new 75mm / 3 Aperture), five recommended stacks, output controls (480p draft tier added, 21:9 ultrawide preserved), AI director toggle acknowledged with function deferred.
- **Image Mode subsection** in `higgsfield-cinema` — Cinema Studio 3.5 image mode coverage including the four Cinematic models picker (Soul Cinema default, Cinematic Characters, Cinematic Locations, Cinematic Cameras), Featured models acknowledgment, image-mode aspect ratios (8 options), resolution table by selected model, and disambiguation between Soul Cinema (Cinematic model) and Higgsfield Soul Cinema (Featured model).
- **Elements System extension** in `higgsfield-cinema` — five source tabs (Uploads / Image Generations / Video Generations / Elements / Liked) and six element categories (All / Pinned / Shared / Characters / Locations / Props), library-first workflow guidance, cross-shot continuity tip via Image/Video Generations tabs.
- **Physics Rendering — Resolution Decision Matrix** (cross-model section) in `higgsfield-cinema` — applies to Seedance 2.0 and Cinema Studio 3.x; routing rule for fast/chaotic motion (720p), fine-detail physics (1080p), grounded weight (1080p), and draft/exploration (480p).
- **Cinema Studio 3.5 row** added to the comparison table in `higgsfield-models/SKILL.md` (Cinema Studio version comparison) plus framing paragraph and cross-link blockquote — routing-level coverage that defers full surface documentation to `higgsfield-cinema`.
- **Built-in color grading row** in `higgsfield-models/SKILL.md` Unique Feature Matrix — Cinema Studio 3.5 added alongside Cinema Studio 2.5 with Color Palette axis (8 named palettes) callout.
- **PDF integration audit** at `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md` covering eight community/creator PDFs reviewed externally on 2026-04-24/25 plus hands-on UI verification of Cinema Studio 3.5 conducted on 2026-04-25.

### Changed
- **Cinema Studio version comparison table** in `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` — fourth column added for Cinema Studio 3.5 (existing 2.5 and 3.0 columns unchanged).
- **Cinema Studio version comparison table** in `higgsfield-models/SKILL.md` — fourth column added for Cinema Studio 3.5 (existing 2.5 and 3.0 columns unchanged).
- **Kling 3.0 resolution line** in `MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md` — refined from `1080p + 4K HDR` to `720p / 1080p / 4K HDR` reflecting the current quality dropdown (4K was already documented; 720p added).
- **Cinema Studio 3.0 section** in `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` — one-bullet Soul Cinema acknowledgment appended to the Quick Specs subsection (forward-link to the new 3.5 Image Mode subsection, since Soul Cinema is the shared default image model across 3.0 and 3.5).
- **Routing entries and sub-skill triggers** in root `SKILL.md` updated to surface Cinema Studio 3.5 (routing table first row expanded, new dedicated 3.5 routing row added, sub-skills triggers row expanded with Style Settings / Camera Settings / Manual Style keywords).
- **Root `SKILL.md` "What Is Higgsfield?" paragraph** — `Cinema Studio 2.5 and Cinema Studio 3.0` expanded to `Cinema Studio 2.5, Cinema Studio 3.0 (Business/Team plan), and Cinema Studio 3.5`.
- **Root `SKILL.md` frontmatter** version bumped to 3.6.0 / 2026-04-25.
- **`higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` frontmatter** version bumped from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0 / 2026-04-25 (mirrors the v3.5.0 sub-skill bump pattern).

### Sourcing
Additions informed by hands-on UI verification of Cinema Studio 3.5 conducted on 2026-04-25 plus eight community/creator PDFs reviewed externally. Full gap analysis preserved in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT-v3.6.0.md`. The v3.4.0 audit report at `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT.md` remains the methodology template. Cinema Studio 3.5 image-mode and Cinematic models picker findings sourced from a 2026-04-25 hands-on UI verification pass that surfaced beyond the CinemaStudioRecap PDF coverage. The vocabulary-routing rule ("vocabulary follows the model you have selected") replaces an earlier draft framing that incorrectly described Cinematic Cameras as a toggle.

### Notes
- ADDITIVE-ONLY discipline preserved with **four explicit LIMITED MODIFICATIONs**:
  1. Cinema Studio version comparison table in `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` extended with a 3.5 column (existing 2.5/3.0 columns untouched).
  2. Cinema Studio version comparison table in `higgsfield-models/SKILL.md` extended with a 3.5 column (existing 2.5/3.0 columns untouched).
  3. Kling 3.0 resolution line in `MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md` refined from `1080p + 4K HDR` to `720p / 1080p / 4K HDR`.
  4. Cinema Studio 3.0 section in `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` — one-bullet Soul Cinema acknowledgment appended to the Quick Specs subsection.
- Root `SKILL.md` frontmatter, dispatcher entries, and "What Is Higgsfield?" line updated to surface 3.5 (in-scope routine bookkeeping for a new sub-skill version, not counted as a LIMITED MODIFICATION).
- AI director toggle acknowledged but function deferred to a future release.
- Backlog items deferred to v3.6.1+: Mr. Core methodology integration (piano test, Morph Cut breathing room, action choreography, studio-vs-cinematic re-pass); 6-Pass Testing Protocol gap-check against the existing Iteration Rule; Transformation prompt mode addition; Seedance 2.0 worked-example library expansion; per-Cinematic-model deep workflow guidance (image and video) — when to pick each Cinematic model for which intent, prompting patterns specific to each, video-mode picker structure; strip product-marketing language from skill content (file-wide pass on `MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md`).
- MANDATORY WORKFLOW and HARD RULES blocks in root `SKILL.md` (lines 27–43) verified byte-for-byte unchanged.
- No new sub-skills created in this release — Elements System extension and Cinema Studio 3.5 documentation both live in the existing `higgsfield-cinema` sub-skill per the established dispatcher routing.
- `higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` frontmatter bumped 3.0.0 → 3.1.0 / 2026-04-25 to reflect the additive content scope (mirrors the v3.5.0 sub-skill bump pattern for `higgsfield-workspaces`).

## v3.5.0 — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Sketch-to-Video / Draw-to-Video workspace** expansion in `higgsfield-workspaces` — full coverage of input characteristics, prompt role, two prompt patterns (Realization and Variation), and use cases for ideation-phase work.
- **Sora 2 Trends workspace** expansion in `higgsfield-workspaces` — distinguishes the templated workspace from raw Sora 2 model use, documents the vertical-first / pacing-optimized characteristics and trade-offs vs. Cinema Studio.
- **Higgsfield Audio standalone workspace** expansion in `higgsfield-workspaces` — three core capabilities (voiceover, voice swap, translation), distinct from Lipsync Studio (audio-to-video sync) and from in-video audio layering (SCELA in `higgsfield-audio`).

### Changed
- `higgsfield-workspaces/SKILL.md` minor version bumped from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 (additive expansions to existing workspace descriptions; no breaking changes).
- Root `SKILL.md` frontmatter bumped to version 3.5.0.

### Sourcing
Additions informed by the v3.4.0 PDF audit (Higgsfield Tools Guide items 5, 6, 8) and the broader workspace-first framing established in v3.4.0. Full gap analysis preserved in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT.md`.

### Notes
- All three additions live in the `higgsfield-workspaces` sub-skill — single-file scope.
- No new sub-skills, no routing changes in root `SKILL.md` (only frontmatter version bumped).
- This release closes out the workspace-related MEDIUM backlog from the v3.4.0 audit.
- REINFORCE polish items remain deferred indefinitely.

## v3.4.1 — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Motion Control failure diagnostic** in `higgsfield-troubleshoot` — symptom → root cause → fix mapping for common Kling 3.0 Motion Control failures, cross-referenced to the workflow added in v3.4.0.
- **Reference Sheet Types** section in `higgsfield-cinema` — extends the Location Reference Sheets pattern from v3.4.0 with three additional reference-sheet categories: Motion/Camera, Outfit/Material, and Palette/Mood.
- **The Iteration Rule** in `higgsfield-prompt` — named methodology for single-variable iteration when refining prompts.

### Sourcing
Additions informed by the PDF audit captured in v3.4.0. Specifically: Kling Motion Control handbook (failure diagnostic), Seedance 2.0 handbook (reference-sheet types), AI Prompting Handbook + Higgsfield Tools Guide (iterate-one-variable rule). Full gap analysis preserved in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT.md`.

### Notes
- No existing content modified. This release is purely additive.
- Root `SKILL.md` not modified — no new sub-skill, no routing changes.
- Three MEDIUM-priority items shipped from the audit backlog. Remaining workspace-expansion MEDIUMs (Sketch-to-Video, Sora 2 Trends, Higgsfield Audio standalone) deferred to v3.5.0.

## v3.4.0 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Location Reference Sheets** pattern in `higgsfield-cinema` — five-view spec for treating locations as first-class assets parallel to character sheets.
- **Seedance 2.0 Prompt Modes** section in `higgsfield-seedance` — documents Reference-Based, Continuation, Expand Shot, and Edit Shot as distinct generation modes with prompt-construction patterns.
- **Continuation Prompt Formula** section in `higgsfield-seedance` — five-rule named pattern for writing continuation prompts (last-frame anchor, identity anchor, prior clip as secondary memory, immediate continuation, no action repeat).
- **Kling 3.0 Motion Control workflow** in `higgsfield-motion` — 8-step Higgsfield UI walkthrough for invoking Motion Control, plus a motion-reference input quality checklist. Cross-referenced from `MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md`.
- **New sub-skill `higgsfield-workspaces`** — workspace-first decision layer that routes users to the right Higgsfield workspace (Cinema Studio / Lipsync Studio / Draw-to-Video / Sora 2 Trends / Click to Ad / Higgsfield Audio) based on the production problem, before model selection.

### Sourcing
Additions informed by review of official Higgsfield documentation (Cinema Studio 3.0 handbook, Seedance 2.0 handbook, Kling Motion Control handbook, Higgsfield Tools Guide) and third-party AI prompting reference material. Source PDFs are not committed to this repo; analysis preserved in `docs/pdf-audit/AUDIT-REPORT.md`.

### Notes
- No existing content modified. This release is purely additive.
- Root `SKILL.md` routing tables updated with two new rows only — MANDATORY WORKFLOW and HARD RULES unchanged.
- MEDIUM and REINFORCE items from the audit deferred to future releases.

## v3.3.0 — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING (install paths):** Flattened skill structure. The dispatcher `SKILL.md` now lives at the repo root. Sub-skills moved from `mnt/user-data/outputs/higgsfield/skills/` to `./skills/`. Templates moved from `mnt/user-data/outputs/higgsfield/templates/` to `./templates/`. The `mnt/user-data/outputs/` directory has been removed — it was a Claude runtime artifact path, not a canonical skill install location.
- The old root `SKILL.md` (scoped to model-guide only) has been merged into `skills/higgsfield-models/SKILL.md`. Users should now point to the new unified dispatcher.

### Added
- Explicit **MANDATORY WORKFLOW** and **HARD RULES** blocks at the top of the root `SKILL.md`, hardened for Claude Opus 4.7's literal instruction-following behavior. The model will now route requests through sub-skills and apply MCSLA without needing to be told manually.
- First-response one-line sub-skill confirmation rule so users see the skill engaged.

### Fixed
- Broadened skill `description` frontmatter so the skill triggers on generic video-prompt requests, not just model-selection queries.
- Fixed all relative path references after the flatten.

### Migration
- If you installed via `cp -r` to `~/.claude/skills/`, re-clone from `main` — the install path changed.
- If you use Claude.ai Projects, re-upload the root `SKILL.md` as your project instruction base.

## v3.2.0 — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **`higgsfield-seedance` sub-skill** — dedicated Seedance 2.0 / Pro prompt director
  that enforces the filmmaker-voice discipline required to pass Seedance's LLM-based
  content filter on the first try. Routes from the parent skill on any Seedance
  prompt request, flagged-prompt report, or Seedance credit-waste complaint.
  - Filter model explainer (LLM reads full-scene intent, not a keyword blacklist)
  - Instant-fail vs. delayed-fail diagnostic heuristic
  - Six-slot Seedance prompt formula (Camera + Subject + Action + Setting + Style + Lighting)
  - Rewrite playbook for real names, brands/IP, violence, weapons, horror
  - "Filmmaker not Friend" voice rewrite pass (6 rules)
  - Failure-loop recovery protocol with filter-memory logging
- **`seedance_lint.py` — pre-flight linter** at the project root. Pure stdlib,
  no dependencies. Scans a drafted prompt for 11 filter-risk patterns before
  the user burns credits on an instant-fail rejection.
  - FAIL rules: real-person names, brand/IP, violence verbs, weapon nouns,
    age markers, overlength (>220 words)
  - WARN rules: antislop adjectives, long prompts (>180 words), too-short
    prompts (<15 words), missing Style/Mood clause, missing camera move,
    missing setting, contradictory instructions
  - Output: PASS / WARN / FAIL verdict with per-rule fix suggestions
  - Usage: `python3 seedance_lint.py "<prompt>"` or pipe via stdin or `--file`
  - Exit code 1 on FAIL for CI / script integration
  - **Filter-memory loopback:** `--log` appends FAIL verdicts to
    `db/filter-memory.json` with rule hits as `blocked_terms` + `tags` and
    fix suggestions as `substitution`. `--confirmed` logs a rewrite that
    passed Seedance's filter in a real generation (outcome=workaround,
    substitution_worked=True). Update outcomes later with
    `python3 higgsfield_memory.py update-filter <id> <outcome>`.
- Parent skill routing table + sub-skills list updated to surface
  `higgsfield-seedance` for Seedance / flagged-prompt triggers.

## v3.1.0 — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Seedance 2.0 Scene Archetype Router** (`higgsfield-prompt`) — planning layer on top of MCSLA
  - Action archetypes: Pursuit / Duel / Impact with decision tree
  - General archetypes: Journey / Atmosphere / Reveal with decision tree
  - Dialogue archetypes: Confrontation / Interrogation / Negotiation with decision tree
  - Dialogue word-limit rule (~25–30 spoken words per 15s)
- **Seedance 2.0 Engine Constraints** (`higgsfield-prompt`) — hard rendering rules
  - ≤3 characters tracked across cuts
  - Exit-frame = implicit cut (never choreograph exit + re-entry)
  - Off-screen = nonexistent (state changes must be shown before referenced)
  - Avoid reflection shots (breaks scene geography)
  - Only see-or-hear (no smell/taste/internal thoughts)
  - Action beats = intent + named technique, not joint mechanics
  - Double-contrast cut rule (shot size AND camera character both change)
  - Causally-motivated inserts with named subject
  - Age-blind character rule (describe by role/clothing/action)
  - Default in medias res
- **Pipeline E: Multi-Style Short Film** (`higgsfield-pipeline`) — Soul Cinema + Nano Banana Pro + Seedance 2.0 chain
  - Style-first keyframe generation with Soul Cinema enhancer ON + minimal prompts
  - Style keyword locators (swap 1–2 words to change whole aesthetic)
  - Edit-don't-regenerate workflow via Nano Banana Pro
  - Prop sheet technique (one-time, multi-angle, material breakdown)
  - Previous-video-as-continuity-reference feedback loop (the key consistency trick)
  - 15-second-per-scene cap rationale
  - 6 pipeline-specific pitfalls
- **Cut & Continuity Vocabulary** section in `vocab.md`
  - Double contrast, camera character, re-anchoring, 180° rule
  - Exit-frame = implicit cut, causally-motivated insert
  - Match cut, smash cut, hard cut, L-cut / J-cut, whip-pan transition
- `docs/Seedance 2 Skill.md` — reference file for the full bilingual EN+ZH Seedance director mode (standalone JSON API pattern)

### Changed
- `higgsfield-prompt` bumped to v3.1.0 (Seedance archetype router + engine constraints added)
- `higgsfield-pipeline` bumped to v3.1.0 (Pipeline E added, decision guide updated)

## v3.0.0 — 2026-04-06

- Genre templates updated with Cinema Studio 3.0 genre mappings and Speed Ramp recommendations
- Dispatcher routing table updated with Cinema Studio 3.0 entries
- Unique Feature Matrix expanded with Cinema Studio 3.0 capabilities

### Preserved
- All Cinema Studio 2.5 documentation remains intact and fully supported
- MCSLA formula retained as primary framework throughout
- All v2.0.2 content preserved — this update is purely additive

---

## v2.0.2 — 2026-03-26

### Fixed: Higgsfield DoP documented as model family
- "Higgsfield DOP" was treated as a single model. DoP is actually the family/brand name for Higgsfield's I2V system with three quality tiers: Higgsfield Lite, Standard, and Turbo (all 720p, 3–5s).
- Added DoP family section to model-guide.md with tier breakdown, 50+ preset categories, and optical physics capabilities.
- Added DoP row to video model comparison tables and decision flowcharts in model-guide.md and higgsfield-models/SKILL.md.
- Updated root SKILL.md, dispatcher SKILL.md, README.md, and CHANGELOG.md references from "Higgsfield DOP" to "Higgsfield DoP (Lite/Standard/Turbo)".

### Fixed: Kling 2.1 Master marked as deprecated
- Kling 2.1 Master is no longer on the platform. Marked as "(deprecated)" in model-guide.md and MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md with notice to use Kling 2.6 or 3.0.
- Removed from Create Video tab model list in model-guide.md.

### Fixed: Grok Imagine Image removed from image model listings
- "Grok Imagine Image" does not exist on the Higgsfield platform — Grok Imagine is a video-only model family.
- Removed from image model quick selection table and decision flowchart in higgsfield-models/SKILL.md.
- Removed from cost table in image-models.md.
- Added "NOT available on Higgsfield" notice to the xAI API documentation section in MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md (documentation preserved for reference).
- Updated Quick Decision Table to redirect former Grok Imagine Image recommendations to GPT Image 1.5, Multi Reference, and Flux Kontext.

### Fixed: Seedance 2.0 labeled as upcoming
- Seedance 2.0 is pre-documented but not yet live on the platform. Added "(upcoming)" labels across model-guide.md, higgsfield-models/SKILL.md, MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md, higgsfield-audio/SKILL.md, higgsfield-troubleshoot/SKILL.md, and shared/negative-constraints.md.
- Decision flowcharts now note "use Seedance 1.5 Pro until launch" as fallback.

### Updated: Version bumped to 2.0.2
- All 21 SKILL.md files, MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md, and README.md bumped from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.

---

## v2.0.1 — 2026-03-26

### Fixed: Broken shared/negative-constraints.md paths (14 instances)
- 13 sub-skill SKILL.md files referenced `shared/negative-constraints.md` using paths relative to their own directory, which didn't resolve. Fixed to `../shared/negative-constraints.md` in all sub-skills.

### Fixed: Model name accuracy
- **"Nano Banana Pro 2" does not exist.** Corrected to "Nano Banana Pro" across 5 files (13 instances). "Nano Banana", "Nano Banana 2", and "Nano Banana Pro" are three separate models — they were previously conflated.
- **"MiniMax" → "Minimax"** — platform spells it "Minimax Hailuo" (lowercase 'imax'). Fixed across 13 files (26 instances).

### Fixed: Templates missing Identity/Motion guidance
- Templates 01 (action chase), 02 (product UGC), and 07 (landscape) now include Identity/Motion Block callouts referencing template 06 and `higgsfield-soul`.
- Template 03 (horror) restructured: Identity/Motion Block sections moved before Variations to match the format used by the other 9 templates.

### Fixed: MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md frontmatter regression
- `tags` was at the top level instead of inside `metadata` — the exact bug v1.5.1 fixed. Moved back inside `metadata`.

### Fixed: Memory system bugs (higgsfield_memory.py + JSON DBs)
- **ID prefix mismatch:** Seeded entries used `filt-`/`qual-` prefixes but code generates `F-`/`Q-`. Aligned seeded data to match code (`F-001`–`F-004`, `Q-001`–`Q-005`).
- **Date field mismatch:** Seeded entries used `"date"` but code reads `"date_added"`. Renamed in all 9 seeded entries.
- **Missing `outcome` field:** Added `"outcome": "workaround"` to all 4 filter entries.
- **Docstring:** Added `update-quality` to usage docstring (command was wired but undocumented).

### Fixed: README.md structure tree
- Added `validate.py`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `USER-GUIDE.pdf` to the project tree.

### Fixed: validate.py
- Added check for `tags` at top level of frontmatter (the regression it was created to prevent).
- Removed unused `SKILL_DIRS` variable.

### Fixed: Minor consistency
- `higgsfield-recall/SKILL.md`: moved non-standard `compatibility` block inside `metadata`.

### Updated: Version bumped to 2.0.1
- All 21 SKILL.md files, MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md, and README.md bumped from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1.

---

## v2.0.0 — 2026-03-26

### New: Shared Negative Constraints Reference
- Created `skills/shared/negative-constraints.md` — a consolidated, categorized reference of all AI video/image generation artifacts and the prompt phrasing to prevent them.
- Six categories: Body/Motion Artifacts, Face/Identity Artifacts, Texture/Lighting Artifacts, Temporal/Consistency Artifacts, Content Filter/Safety Artifacts, Cinema Studio–Specific Artifacts.
- Each entry includes: the artifact, why it happens in AI video, and the recommended prevention phrase.
- All 18 sub-skills updated to reference this shared file for their relevant artifact categories.
- Domain-specific constraints that only apply to one sub-skill remain in that sub-skill — the shared file supplements, not replaces.

### New: Identity vs. Motion Separation Rule
- Added hard rule to `higgsfield-prompt` and `higgsfield-soul`: when Soul ID or character consistency is involved, prompts must be split into two blocks:
  - **Identity Block** — static visual descriptors only (face, clothing, body, marks). No motion, no camera, no temporal language.
  - **Motion Block** — camera movement, action, speed, environmental changes. No character description repetition.
- Includes 3 before/after examples showing mixed (bad) vs. separated (good) prompts with explanations.
- Added "which descriptors belong where" reference table.
- Updated `higgsfield-recipes`, `higgsfield-pipeline`, `higgsfield-cinema`, and `higgsfield-recall` to reference this separation rule.
- All 10 genre templates include Identity Block + Motion Block sections for character-involved prompts.

### New: Templates Folder (10 annotated genre templates)
- Created `templates/` directory with 10 production-quality annotated prompt templates:
  1. `01-cinematic-action-chase.md` — Chase/pursuit sequences
  2. `02-product-ugc-showcase.md` — Product ads and UGC content

## v1.5.2 — 2026-03-18

### Fixed: higgsfield_memory.py — Robustness
- Added `ValueError` handling around `int(sys.argv[3])` in `query-filter` and `query-quality` — passing a non-integer `top_n` argument now returns a clean JSON error instead of an unhandled crash.
- Made `export_summary()` atomic — writes to `.tmp` then renames, consistent with `save_db()`. Prevents partial/corrupted output on interrupted writes.

### Fixed: higgsfield-recall/SKILL.md — Broken command references
- Changed `python higgsfield_memory.py ...` → `python3` in all three code blocks. `python` is not in PATH on modern macOS/Linux.
- Replaced reference to non-existent `higgsfield-learn` skill with the correct `higgsfield-troubleshoot`.

### Fixed: validate.py — Typo
- Corrected "Highsfield" → "Higgsfield" in the validation report header.

## v1.5.1 — 2026-03-18

### Fixed: higgsfield_memory.py — Critical error handling
- Added try-except around `json.loads()` in `add_filter()` and `add_quality()` — malformed JSON no longer crashes the script; returns a structured error response instead.
- Made `save_db()` atomic — writes to a `.tmp` file then renames it, preventing database corruption if the process is interrupted mid-write.
- Added try-except to `load_db()` covering missing file and corrupted JSON cases.
- Added deterministic secondary sort key (`date_added`) to `query_filter()` and `query_quality()` — equal-scored results now return in consistent order.
- Improved tokenizer — hyphenated terms (e.g. `real-person`) now match as a whole phrase AND as individual component words, improving filter memory accuracy.
- Removed unused `import os`.

### Fixed: higgsfield_memory.py — New `health` command
- Added `python3 higgsfield_memory.py health` — runs a quick integrity check on both database files (validates JSON, verifies entry counts match `_total_entries`).

### Fixed: db/filter-memory.json — Schema completeness
- Added missing `substitution_worked` field (was `null`-defaulted in code but absent from all 4 seeded entries).

### Fixed: db/quality-memory.json — Field naming consistency
- Renamed `model` → `model_used` and `category` → `failure_type` in all 5 entries to match what `add_quality()` writes.
- Added missing `outcome` and `improvement_confirmed` fields to all 5 entries.

### Fixed: SKILL.md frontmatter — Invalid top-level attributes
- Moved `tags` from top-level into `metadata` block across all 20 SKILL.md files (`tags` is not a supported top-level skill attribute).
- Moved `references` from top-level into `metadata` block in `SKILL.md` and `higgsfield-models/SKILL.md`.

### Fixed: Broken relative paths
- Main dispatcher (`mnt/user-data/outputs/higgsfield/SKILL.md`): corrected bare filenames `vocab.md`, `model-guide.md`, `prompt-examples.md` to proper relative paths (`../../../../`).
- `higgsfield-models/SKILL.md`: corrected `image-models.md` reference to `../../../../../../image-models.md`.

### Fixed: README — Incorrect install command
- Changed `cp -r higgsfield_v140` to `git clone … && cp -r higgsfield_v150` with correct repo path.
- Corrected directory diagram label from `higgsfield_v150/` to `higgsfield/ (repo root)`.
- Corrected Cowork install instruction (was referencing a non-existent `higgsfield_v150/` subfolder).

### New: validate.py — Pre-release health checker
- Added `validate.py` at repo root: verifies all SKILL.md files have valid frontmatter, all relative path references resolve to real files, both JSON databases are valid and schema-complete, and all expected root files are present.
- Run with `python3 validate.py` before any release. Exits 0 on pass, 1 on failure with itemised report.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-03-13

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — 3D Mode (Gaussian Splatting)
- Documented the 3D exploration feature that builds a 3D Gaussian splat from any generated image.
- Virtual camera orbit around generated scenes — front, side, back, above.
- Creative workflow: generate image → enter 3D Mode → orbit to new angle → capture as new start frame → animate.
- Best practices for source images (single subjects, clear geometry, even lighting).

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Grid Generation (Batch Variations)
- Documented 2×2 and 4×4 grid generation modes for producing multiple variations from a single prompt.
- 2×2 = 4 variations per credit; 4×4 = 16 variations per credit.
- Use cases: A/B testing compositions, character sheet creation, finding the best start frame.

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Resolution Settings
- Documented explicit resolution control: 1K (fast drafts), 2K (default production), 4K (final delivery).
- Higher resolution = longer generation time, same credit cost.

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Frame Extraction Loop
- Documented the iterative Build → Animate → Extract → Feed Back → Repeat workflow.
- Extract any frame from a generated video as a new start image for the next generation.
- Key technique for extending sequences beyond single-clip duration limits.

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Object & Person Insertion
- Documented the ability to insert characters or objects not present in the original start frame.
- Describe the new element in the prompt; the model composites it into the scene.
- Best practices: match lighting, keep scale plausible, one insertion per generation.

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — 12-Second Total Runtime Cap
- Added critical warning to Multi-Shot Manual section: total runtime across all scenes is capped at 12 seconds.
- Duration allocation strategy: plan scene durations before building to avoid hitting the cap.

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Per-Character Emotion Controls
- Documented per-character emotion settings in the Elements system: Joy, Fear, Surprise, Sadness.
- Applied per character per scene in Multi-Shot Manual mode.

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Clustering (Automatic Generation Grouping)
- Documented the automatic grouping feature that clusters generations from the same prompt.
- Expand/collapse cluster groups for project organization.

### New: Soul ID — Character Sheet Creation
- Added Character Sheet workflow to the Soul ID skill.
- Multi-angle reference images (front, 3/4, side, full body) for improved consistency.
- How to create character sheets using Grid Generation and 3D Mode.
- Why multi-angle references improve Soul ID consistency across extreme angle changes.

### Updated: Cinema Studio comparison table
- Added rows for 3D exploration and batch generation to the Cinema Studio vs Standard comparison.

### Updated: All sub-skills version bumped to 1.5.0

---

## v1.4.0 — 2026-03-05

### Fixed: MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md — Duplicate YAML key
- Removed duplicate `user-invokable: true` key from frontmatter (kept correct `user-invocable: true`).

### New: Cinematic Still Images section in prompt-examples.md
- Added 3 fully worked cinematic still image examples using the v1.3.9 Image Prompt Formula (`[Shot size] + [Angle] + [Movement keyword] of [character]. [Pose]. [Environment]. [Lighting]. [Style].`).
- **Example 8 — Sci-Fi Character Tension** (Nano Banana Pro, 16:9): MCU + Low Angle + Dolly Zoom. Cyber-enhanced operative in neon rain.
- **Example 9 — Epic Fantasy Scale** (Seedream 4.5, 16:9): EWS + Overhead + Crane Up. Lone warrior on a shattered bridge over a lava chasm.
- **Example 10 — Psychological Thriller Detail** (Nano Banana Pro, 3:4): ECU + Dutch Angle + Rack Focus. Lipstick-smeared mirror reflection in a dim bathroom.
- Covers a mix of models, aspect ratios, and genres.

### Fixed: higgsfield_memory.py — Directory fallback bug
- Replaced fragile `if not DB_DIR.exists(): DB_DIR = SCRIPT_DIR` fallback with `DB_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
- Ensures the `db/` directory is always created rather than silently falling back to the script directory (which would misplace database files).

### Fixed: prompt-examples.md — Audio duration correction
- Example 5 (Audio-Driven Scene): changed duration from `10s` to `8s` to match Seedance 1.5 Pro's recommended lip-sync sweet spot (3–8s).

### New: Memory summary for cold-start resolution
- Generated `db/memory-summary.md` via `python3 higgsfield_memory.py export-summary`.
- Human-readable snapshot of all 4 filter memory entries and 5 quality memory entries.
- Added to project knowledge base for automatic context loading — eliminates cold-start gap where Claude previously had no recall of past generation failures.

---

## v1.3.9 — 2026-03-04

### New: higgsfield-image-shots sub-skill — Cinematic Image Prompting
- New dedicated sub-skill for **still image** prompt composition, separate from video camera controls.

---

## v1.3.8 — 2026-03-04

### New: Cinema Studio 2.0 — Prompt Character Limit (512 chars)
- Documented the **hard 512-character limit** on Cinema Studio prompt fields.
- @ Element chips consume ~80–100 hidden characters each for internal metadata.
- Added character budget guidelines: ~250 visible chars with 2 tags, ~350 with 1, ~450 with 0.

### New: @ Element Persistence Rule
- Discovered that @ Elements added in **Scene 1 persist across all scenes** in Multi-Shot Manual.
- No need to re-add @ tags in Scenes 2–6. Characters carry through via Reference Anchor.
- Recommended pattern: @ Elements in Scene 1, visual descriptions in subsequent scenes.

### New: Fight Scene Rules (Tested)
- Documented what Cinema Studio CAN and CANNOT render in two-character fight sequences.
- CAN: facing each other, general fighting energy, pinned against wall, falling, walking away.
- CANNOT: specific punch contact, kicks, martial arts, cause-and-effect choreography, prop weapons, grappling.
- Documented **character swap problem**: two @ tags in action scenes causes the AI to confuse hero/villain roles.
- Added fight sequence template alternating @ Element scenes (character) with plain text scenes (action).

### New: Prompting Best Practices (from Higgsfield official)
- Added **pre-prompt checklist**: Who, Where, What's happening, Camera, Mood/Genre.

- Added **fast motion trick**: generate in Slow Mo, speed up in post.

### Updated: Common Prompt Mistakes table
- Added 4 new entries: over 512 chars, impact before action, specific martial arts, multiple @ tags in action.

## v1.3.7 — 2026-02-28

### Architecture: De-duplication pass
- **Root SKILL.md** stripped from 146 to 42 lines — removed full model tables and quick reference that duplicated `model-guide.md`. Now a lean index with cross-references only.
- **Dispatcher SKILL.md** stripped from 219 to ~170 lines — removed duplicated MCSLA definition (lives in `higgsfield-prompt`), model selection table (lives in `higgsfield-models`), and platform quick reference. Keeps only workflow, routing table, output format.
- Net token savings: ~300 lines of duplicated content removed from default context window load.

### New: Fast Path for simple requests
- Dispatcher now distinguishes between **fast path** (clear creative intent, no constraints → generate immediately with sensible defaults) and **full path** (production-grade → confirm parameters first).
- Defaults: 16:9, 8s, Cinematic, Kling 3.0 (character) or Sora 2 (action), Soul 2.0 (portrait) or Nano Banana Pro (other images).

### Fixed: Recall system paths
- `higgsfield_memory.py` path changed from `SCRIPT_DIR.parent / "db"` to `SCRIPT_DIR / "db"` with fallback to same-directory. Matches actual directory layout.
- Created `db/` directory and moved `filter-memory.json` into it.
- Created `quality-memory.json` (was missing entirely).
- Updated all `higgsfield-recall/SKILL.md` bash commands from `scripts/higgsfield_memory.py` to `higgsfield_memory.py`.

### New: Seeded memory databases
- `filter-memory.json` seeded with 4 entries: real-person blocks, brand/IP blocks, violence filter, Seedance 2.0 face upload restriction.
- `quality-memory.json` seeded with 5 entries: character drift (Sora 2), VHS style ignored (Kling 2.6), I2V static output, camera conflict, lip-sync desync (Seedance 1.5 Pro).

### Slimmed: higgsfield-models
- Split into compact `SKILL.md` (~200 lines, handles 90% of model selection) and `MODELS-DEEP-REFERENCE.md` (full 1021-line per-model documentation, loaded on-demand).
- SKILL.md contains: comparison table, decision flowchart, image quick selection, budget tiers, unique feature matrix, key model notes.

### New: higgsfield-audio sub-skill
- Full audio prompting guide covering all audio-capable models (Kling 3.0, Seedance 1.5 Pro/2.0, Veo 3/3.1, Grok Imagine Video).
- Four audio layers: Dialogue, SFX, Ambient, BGM — with prompt structure and best practices.
- Lip-sync rules: timing, framing, token conflicts, multi-character workaround.
- Per-model audio notes and common failure/fix table.

### New: Before → After prompt examples
- 5 transformation examples added to `prompt-examples.md` showing weak → strong prompt improvement.
- Covers: vague→specific, over-described I2V, slop words, camera conflicts, missing audio direction.

### Consistency pass
- All sub-skills bumped to version 1.3.7.
- `higgsfield-troubleshoot` updated: character consistency recommendation changed from "Kling 2.6" to "Kling 3.0 (or 2.6 if no audio needed)". VFX recommendation updated. Audio troubleshooting sections added.

- Dispatcher routing table updated with `higgsfield-audio` entry.

---

## v1.3.6 — 2026-02-28

### higgsfield-models/SKILL.md — Grok Imagine family added (was completely absent)

Grok Imagine (`grok-imagine-image` and `grok-imagine-video`) had zero entries anywhere in the library despite being live on the platform. Both models documented from scratch using the official xAI API docs (docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/images/generation and video/generation).

**Architecture context documented:**
Aurora is an autoregressive mixture-of-experts network — architecturally distinct from diffusion models. Predicts next token from interleaved text+image data. This gives it tighter compositional control, stronger multi-element scene understanding, and reliable text/logo rendering where diffusion models fail.

**`grok-imagine-image` — new complete entry:**
- Text-to-image with full aspect ratio table (10 ratios including `auto`, `19.5:9`, `20:9`)
- Resolution: 1k / 2k
- Image editing (single image): source image + prompt, output follows input ratio. Critical note: OpenAI SDK `images.edit()` uses `multipart/form-data` which is NOT supported — must use xAI SDK or `application/json` directly
- Multi-image editing (up to 3 source images): ordered input, cross-image compositing, aspect ratio override
- Multi-turn iterative editing chain: use each output URL as next input — primary recommended workflow for complex compositions
- Style transfer: photorealistic → anime → oil painting → pencil sketch → watercolor → pop art
- Batch generation: up to 10 images per request via `n` parameter
- Aurora differentiators table: text/logo rendering, multi-person scenes, precise prompt adherence, photorealism, iterative chains, batch A/B testing
- Content moderation: `response.respect_moderation` flag documented

**`grok-imagine-video` — new complete entry:**
- Duration: 1–15s (generation); editing preserves source duration (not user-configurable)
- Resolution: 720p (cap for both generation and editing; 1080p input downsized)
- Audio: ✅ native — dialogue, SFX, ambient, music
- Generation modes: T2V, I2V, video editing/restyling
- Async workflow: `request_id` → poll until `status: "done"` → download from temporary URL
- Video editing constraints: input must be publicly accessible URL; output capped at 720p; duration not configurable
- Imagine 1.0 (Feb 1, 2026): duration extended to 10s, improved audio quality, video editing (add/remove objects, restyle, motion control)
- Grok Imagine internal decision table (8 rows, image vs video routing)

**model-guide.md:**
- Grok Imagine Video added to video table
- Grok Imagine Video added to decision flowchart

**image-models.md:**
- Grok Imagine Image added to pricing/capability table

**Quick Decision Table (higgsfield-models SKILL.md):**
- 7 new Grok Imagine rows added (5 image, 2 video)

---

## v1.3.5 — 2026-02-28


### higgsfield-models/SKILL.md — Google Veo family complete rewrite

The library had one thin "Veo 3 (Google)" entry (6 lines). The UI shows 4 Veo models on platform. Google's official API docs (ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video) confirm Veo 3.1 has significant exclusive capabilities missing from all previous documentation.

**New entries: Veo 3.1, Veo 3.1 Fast, Veo 3 Fast** (in addition to expanded Veo 3)

**Veo 3.1 — new capabilities documented (3.1-exclusive features):**
- Reference images (up to 3): `reference_type: "asset"` — preserves subject appearance (character face, outfit, prop) consistently throughout video. Veo 3.1 and 3.1 Fast only, not available in Veo 3/3 Fast.
- First + last frame interpolation: specify opening and closing frame images; model generates the motion between them. Duration must be 8s when using this feature.
- Video extension: extend any Veo-generated video by 7s, up to 20 times (max 148s total). Input must be 720p. Videos stored 2 days (timer resets on each reference). Voice extension requires audio in last 1s of source.
- 4K output: 8s only, higher latency/cost. 1080p also 8s only. 720p supports all durations (4/6/8s).
- Portrait mode (9:16): available across all Veo 3/3.1 models.

**Duration constraints documented:**
- Reference images / first+last frame / 1080p / 4K → duration must be 8s
- Extension → input must be 720p; output combines original + extension up to 148s

**Audio generation guidance added:**
- Dialogue: use quotes for specific speech
- SFX: describe sounds explicitly (tires screeching, not just "loud sounds")
- Ambient: describe environment soundscape
- Negative prompts: supported (describe what you don't want, no "no X" language)

**Full Veo prompt element framework documented:**
Subject / Action / Style / Camera / Composition / Focus+Lens / Ambiance / Audio

**Veo 3.1 vs Veo 3 comparison table** — 8 capabilities across all 4 models (audio, reference images, first/last frame, extension, 4K, portrait, negative prompts, stable/preview status)

**Veo 3.1 Fast, Veo 3 Fast** — new entries clarifying speed/quality/cost tradeoffs and use cases

**Quick Decision Table** — Veo row expanded from 1 to 5 rows

### model-guide.md
- Video table: Veo row expanded from 1 to 4, audio column corrected to ✅ for all Veo 3/3.1 (was incorrectly ❌), durations added
- Decision flowchart: Veo branch expanded to 5 decision points

## v1.3.4 — 2026-02-28


### higgsfield-models/SKILL.md — Seedance 2.0 full production documentation

Seedance 2.0 has not yet shipped on Higgsfield but is incoming. This version replaces the thin v1.3.3 stub with a complete, production-ready reference document built from two third-party Seedance 2.0 skill libraries (Emily/@iamemily2050's seedance-2.0 v3.8.0 and seedance-bot-1), both containing validated practitioner knowledge from 10,000+ generation testing on the Jimeng/Dreamina platform.

**New sections added to the Seedance 2.0 entry:**

- **Rule of 12** — Full asset budget table with the critical correction that video clips share a 15s combined limit (not 15s per clip). Audio 15s combined limit also documented.
- **Generation Modes (T2V / I2V / V2V / R2V)** — All four modes documented with the critical V2V distinction: reference technique vs. direct edit trigger different model pathways
- **Five-Layer Prompt Stack** — Subject/Action/Camera/Style/Sound architecture with Delegation Levels 1–4, word count ranges, decision rule, and complete examples at each level including Level 4 fight choreography
- **6-Part Field Formula** — `[SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]`, cross-validated on 10,000+ generations
- **Anti-Slop / Prompt Hygiene** — Instant-delete word list and measurable replacement table; the one test: "can a camera, light meter, or stopwatch measure this word?"
- **Camera Control** — Full camera contract (framing/move/speed/angle), reliable phrasing library, anti-drift rules, One-Take technique (一镜到底) with image waypoints, Nine-Grid storyboard method (九宫格)
- **Audio Rules and Failure Modes** — Platform hard limits (MP3 only — WAV/AAC fail silently), sweet spot 3–8s, timestamp anchoring phrase for audio rewrite bug, multi-character compositing workaround, critical Jimeng platform distinction (Seedance 2.0 video generation vs. OmniHuman-1 Digital Human tool — Master/Quick/Standard modes do NOT exist in Seedance 2.0)
- **Character Identity** — Character card format, identity anchoring syntax, multi-character @Tag patterns, 360° consistency test, hand safety rules
- **Beat Density** — Max changes per duration table, Level 4 fight density guidance

- **Emergency Fixes** — 8-row quick-fix table for all common failure modes
- **Platform Parameters** — Confirmed aspect ratios (16:9 · 9:16 · 4:3 · 3:4 · 21:9 · 1:1), resolution tiers, duration range
- **Feb 2026 status note** — Real person face uploads blocked, API delayed, Higgsfield integration incoming

**Quick Decision Table** — Seedance 2.0 expanded from 1 row to 3 rows (R2V / V2V / complex motion routing)

**Key accuracy corrections from practitioner data (vs. earlier documentation):**
- Video clip limit is 15s COMBINED total, not 15s per clip
- Negative prompts (--no syntax) are NOT supported — positive constraints only
- Lip-sync sweet spot is 3–8s, not the 15s technical maximum
- Master/Quick/Standard modes belong to OmniHuman-1 Digital Human, NOT Seedance 2.0
- API is delayed (was planned Feb 24) due to copyright enforcement actions

## v1.3.3 — 2026-02-28


### higgsfield-models/SKILL.md — Seedance Family Complete Rewrite

The library previously had a single thin "Seedance Pro" entry. Three properly documented tiers now replace it:

**Seedance 2.0** — new entry (most advanced tier, was completely missing):
- Architecture: unified multimodal audio-video joint generation (text + image + audio + video inputs)
- 12 simultaneous asset inputs: 9 images + 3 video clips (15s each) + 3 audio files + text
- Model auto-interprets each asset's role; use natural language to specify references
- Motion realism: industry-leading complex multi-person interaction (synchronized sports, fight choreography)
- Acoustic physics: audio calculated from visual environment geometry (not just layered on)
- Frame-level precision: control fonts, transitions, screen rhythm per frame
- Video extension + scene merging with maintained continuity
- ~30% faster generation than comparable 2K models
- Use case: reference choreography video + character images + audio clip → synchronized scene

**Seedance 1.5 Pro** — new entry (was missing — different model from Pro):
- Architecture: dual-branch Diffusion Transformer, simultaneous audio-video single-pass generation
- Multilingual lip-sync: English, Chinese (Sichuanese, Cantonese, Taiwanese Mandarin, Shanghainese), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Indonesian
- Multi-character dialogue with correct lip-motion assignment per character
- Audio types: speech, singing, non-verbal vocalizations, SFX, BGM — all native
- Beats Kling 2.6 and Veo 3.1 on audio-visual synchronization (SeedVideoBench 1.5)
- Cinematic camera: dolly zoom (Hitchcock zoom), long takes, orbital/arc/tracking shots
- Strong in stylized content: comedy timing, theatrical/opera performance, short dramas
- Architecture note: simultaneous generation (not post-production layering) is the key distinction vs competitors

**Seedance Pro** — existing entry expanded:
- Clarified as fast iteration tier, NO native audio
- Pro (1080p) vs Lite (720p) distinction documented
- Correct positioning: use when audio not required; iterate before committing to 1.5 Pro/2.0

**Quick Decision Table** — Seedance row expanded from 1 to 3 rows

### model-guide.md
- Video table: Seedance row expanded from 1 to 3 with audio column correctly marked
- Decision flowchart: Seedance branch updated with audio/no-audio split and Seedance 2.0 option
