# Pairing Higgsfield with Other Skills

Higgsfield is the **visuals layer**. To run the full creative loop, pair it
with sister skills that handle the layers around it: copy, layout, audio,
distribution, post.

This doc is about combinations — what to run before Higgsfield, what to run
after, what to run alongside.

## The full creative loop

```text
1. Strategy        →  ad-creative skill, content-marketer skill
2. Copy + hooks    →  copywriting, direct-response-copy, email-marketing
3. Visuals         →  Higgsfield (this kit)
4. Voice + audio   →  ElevenLabs, Higgsfield Speak, OpenAI TTS
5. Polish          →  nano-banana MCP (image), your editor (video)
6. Layout          →  carousel-generator, Figma, Canva
7. Distribution    →  meta-ads-mcp-setup, social-content, manychat
8. Post-clean      →  humanizer skill (any text that goes live)
```

Most operators try to do everything in one tool. The high-output operators
specialise each layer and chain them.

## Combinations that work

4. copywriting skill            → caption + hook + CTA

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't ask Higgsfield to write copy.** It's a visuals tool. Use a copy
  skill, paste the result back into your Higgsfield prompt as the dialogue
  field.
- **Don't ask a copy skill to choose visuals.** Inverse problem — let each
  skill specialise.
- **Don't skip the humanizer pass.** Anything text-shaped that ends up in
  front of your audience should pass through `humanizer` or `avoid-ai-writing`
  before publishing.
- **Don't let Click-to-Ad be your hero piece.** It's a volume tool. For brand
  hero spots, build deliberately with `selrai-cinema-studio-narrative.md`.
- **Don't run Recast on someone you don't have rights to.** Hard ethical line.
  See `docs/soul-id-workflow.md` § "Ethical guardrails".

## When in doubt

If you're not sure which skill to pair with a Higgsfield output, the answer
is almost always: **`humanizer` on the caption, `nano-banana` on the image,
your editor on the video, `meta-ads-mcp-setup` for distribution.**

That's the four-skill spine of every shipped piece.
