# Higgsfield Creative Kit

**One prompt. Connect Higgsfield to Claude Code. Generate cinematic images and videos with founder-grade templates.**

Built by Selr AI for non-technical founders. Zero API keys. One browser sign-in.

## What's in here

- **Connector skill** — autonomous OAuth installer for the official Higgsfield remote MCP at `https://mcp.higgsfield.ai/mcp`. Adds the connection, verifies it, hands off starter prompts.
- **Prompt skill** — vendored from [OSideMedia/higgsfield-ai-prompt-skill](https://github.com/OSideMedia/higgsfield-ai-prompt-skill) under MIT. 20 sub-skills covering Soul ID, Cinema Studio 2.5/3.0/3.5, Seedance 2.0, Kling 3.0 Motion Control, MCSLA formula, and 10 genre templates.
- **15 founder templates** — 8 image + 7 video, tuned for product, lifestyle, UGC, and ad use cases.
- **Soul ID workflow doc** — train a consistent character once, generate dozens of on-brand visuals.
- **Cookbook** — distilled prompting playbook: image formula, motion formula, the seven hard rules, locked seeds, real-gear references.
- **Pairing guide** — how to combine Higgsfield outputs with carousel generators, copywriting skills, and ad-creative workflows.

## Install

Open Claude Code and paste the prompt from [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](BOOTSTRAP.md). Claude does everything except your one Higgsfield sign-in.

## What you can do after install

- *"Generate a cinematic founder portrait of me holding [my product]"* → `templates/selrai-founder-portrait.md`
- *"Make me an 8-second ASMR scroll-stopper for [my product]"* → `templates/selrai-asmr-scroll-stopper.md`
- *"Create a UGC talking-head ad for [my product] using my Soul ID"* → `templates/selrai-ugc-talking-head.md`
- *"Show me three product hero shots, locked seed, three lighting variants"* → `templates/selrai-product-hero.md`
- *"Train my Soul ID — walk me through it"* → `docs/soul-id-workflow.md`

## What's NOT in here

- **No API keys.** The kit uses OAuth via Higgsfield's official remote MCP — your credentials live on Higgsfield, not in any config file on your machine.
- **No video editing.** Higgsfield generates clips. For stitching, captioning, or final cut, pair with Remotion or your editor of choice.
- **No copywriting.** Pair with Claude's `copywriting` or `direct-response-copy` skills to write the captions and hooks that go with your visuals.
- **No paid ads.** Pair with `paid-ads`, `ad-creative`, or `meta-ads-mcp-setup` for actual campaign launch.
